The WordPress child theme files for www.shetechphilly.com

Pulling down the child theme files from github for the first time:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* cd into the themes folder in your local directory of STP files
* then type: git clone git@github.com:shetechphilly/she-tech-PHL.git she-tech-PHL (this pulls the child theme files to your local computer)
* then cd into she-tech-PHL, and type: git init (this initializes your local git repo)
* if you want to see the hidden git files that you now have in the child theme folder, in a new terminal tab, cd ~, and then type:  defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
* then type: killall Finder (which will close all your finder windows)
* when you reopen finder, you should see the git files shaded out, which means youâ€™re all set!
